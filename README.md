# PocketChef

PocketChef is a cooking website that centralizes recipes across different cultures, countries, and continents. The website is built to be an online space for sharing and discussing the love of cooking - which is why the wbsite enables the user to manage their own portfolio of recipes and connect with others, allowing them to view recipes and blog posts from popular profiles in the PocketChef community, learn from an assembled collection of cooking tutorials meant for beginners and professionals, and much more. The motivation for creating this website came from the love for food and COVID-19 quarantine life which gave a lot of time to experiment with the cooking styles.
